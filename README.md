### Code Journal Entry

  When I started doing this assignment, I wasn't quite sure what to expect or where to start. I had to go back to my notes to figure out what was what, and how to format. For some of the ones that I did on this assignment, I had to do some additional research on what they did, and how they worked.

  Eventually, I was able to understand what was going on, and how each function worked. For some odd reason, I thought this assignment would be very complicated. In reality, it was actually more simple than I thought; I had to think of making strings and numbers like a math formula and using substitution to get the result you need.
